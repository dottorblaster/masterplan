The result of every phase of checking is applied to the following sprint. Application and planning phases are closely connected in that what is the output of the first is taken to be the input of the latter. Like the PDCA, the sprint woks in cycle; it works by exploiting errors and improve the effectiveness of the workflow. 

This section is of general interest and pertains to every level of the architecture.

#### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Prescriptions 

1. The solution to a problem should be satisfactory for each role affected by the problem.2. An implemented upgrade should always be documented so that can be reused to improve the responsiveness of all workers in the building site. 3. The site managers should not impose an upgrade; they should always negotiate the change with team leaders.4. Errors are parts of the building process. They shouldn’t be chancy; rather, they should be a matter of conscious management’s decisions. 5. Failure to document an issue, or a problem, might lead to a more serious failure in the site and, as a consequence, of the project.

#### <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Preventions

1. Is the documentation relative to an upgrade in need of specific expertise?2. Can the site engineer reuse one upgrade to improve the work of other team leaders?3. Can the site manager evaluate how much team leaders are happy with their workload?4. Is the documenting activity seen as an handbook for new possible upgrades?
