The making of a user story involves team leaders and their ability to select and document the tasks that are relevant for the execution of the project. The attribution of a score, based on planning poker methodology, should always be based on a negotiation between the team leader and the site manager. The result of this negotiation must always be clear and unanimous.

This section is of particular interest to Team Leaders, Site Managers and Site Engineers. It pertains to Level 3 (Site Managers-Team Leaders) and Level 2 (Site Engineers-Site Managers) 

#### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Prescriptions

1. The site manager should help each team leader pick the right user story, the one they think they can bear and accomplished without excessive stress or extra work. 2. The site manager coordinates with the site engineer to harmonize and distribute the workload (activities) appropriately across all the team leaders. 3. The harmonization activity performed by the site manager together with the site engineer cannot be accomplished if the goal, around which each user story should be modeled, is not clearly defined. 

#### <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Preventions

1. Is the communication of goals clear and accessible to everyone?2. Is the documentation beneficial for solving problems that emerge in course of activities? 3. Are the executiveâ€™s requests negotiable or they are rigidly tied to some specific activity? 4. Are team leaders capable of explain the activity previously agreed with the site manager?
