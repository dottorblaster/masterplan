Remember, if there is a building site, there is always someone monitoring the workers. Sharing your datahat is the best business card for every professional involved in the building process. Their quality, and the quality of their work, depends on who produce, select and leads them.  That is, on you. 

This section is of particular interest to Team Leaders and pertains to Level 4 (Team Leaders-Team Leaders) and Level 5 (Team Leaders-Datahats)

1. Remember that an activity is the minimal manufacturing element of the building site.2. Remember that a user story is the minimal manufacturing unit of the project.3. A squad of datahat should be clearly defined and must be autonomous in its activity.4. Each activity assigned to a datahat squad should always be brought to completion.5. Each activity assigned to a datahat, when accomplished, can provide the basis for another activity performed by the same, or another, datahat squad.

1. Is it possible to distinguish datahats from the activities they perform?2. Does my datahat squad perform her activity in autonomy or they cooperate with other squad?3. Does my datahat squad already perform some other activities outside of my control?4. Are the datahat activities well-documented? Can you easily explain what is the purpose of their work inside the general structure of the building site?5. How many activities my datahat squad –and their tasks– can support?
