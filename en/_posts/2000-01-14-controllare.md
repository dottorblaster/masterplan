Any verification applies on the methodology by which each tasks are accomplished. To improve means to introduce the right correctives that help the site manager to redesign the same activity and obtain the same result in lesser time and with less stress. Again, errors are constructive parts of production cycle.  

This section is of particular interest to Team Leaders, Site Managers and Site Engineers. It pertains to Level 3 (Site Managers-Team Leaders) and Level 2 (Site Engineers-Site Managers) 

#### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Prescriptions

1. An healthy and flexible workflow depends on Site Managerâ€™s check on tasks and user stories.2. Fix the machine, not the people. Obstacles are often rooted in misunderstanding in the negotiation process at the higher level; avoid blaming people for that.3. The Site Manager prepares the list of obstacles and, together with team leaders, negotiates priorities and solutions.4. There are no hierarchical relations between Site Managers and Team Leaders; they cooperate side by side.5. There are no tasks relieved from obstacles. 6. Boredom and frustration are the worst obstacles for the project.

#### <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Preventions

1. Do Team Leaders have the time to think critically about their tasks?2. Is the Site Manager able to negotiate and attain consensus about what is considered to be an obstacle?3. Does the obstacle consist in the duplication of one task? Or, is the obstacle based upon conflicting tasks? 4. Are all Team Leaders aware of what user stories were arranged?5. Does the Site Engineer takes into consideration the list of obstacle when compiling the backlog?6. Can an obstacle be solved scheduling an appropriate task?
