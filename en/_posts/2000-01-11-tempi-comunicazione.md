Each site manager should be aware that more team leaders work in the building site, more time will be spent to curate communication of tasks and users stories. Documentation can assist in the quest, if and only if the documentation is clear, concise, easy to access and arrange. The documentation play the crucial role of reducing the number of meeting needed between site manager and team leaders. Communication channels can be designed using the formula:

<code>communication channels = n(n-1)/2</code>

where n stands for number of people involved.
