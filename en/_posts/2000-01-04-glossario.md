- **Product Owner** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> is the technical term for The Site Engineer; she keeps the workflow focused on vision and values (as well as keeping the *backlog* up and running). 

- **Scrum Master** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> is the technical term for The Site Manager; helps the team and The Team Leaders to manage obstacles that emerge work in progress.

- **Activity** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> that which is executed for the purpose of managing the Project and keep it clean and efficient.

- **Backlog** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> it is defined by The Site Engineer (*Product Owner*); is the set of user’s stories that are planned and developed by The Team Leaders in order to complete each part of the Project.

- **User Stories** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i>  a user story is a part of the Project, defined in terms of *how long it takes* and *how it is accomplished*. A user story should fit *INVEST* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INVEST_(mnemonic))requirements: 

	* Independent, should not depend on other user stories.
	* Negotiable, if the user story has been already completed it must me converted.
	* Valuable, it must produce value for some other roles in the project.
	* Estimable, it must be estimated in terms of time and value.
	* Small, it must be possible to define the who/what/why of the story (action, segment, result).
	* Testable, it must be possible to test and verify the user story.

- **Tasks** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> ua task is the element of the user story; it should be clearly reported in respect to project’s requirements and *backlog*. A task is made of:

	1. the author or owner or the task;  
	2. the goal: 

		- how
		- what

	3. time-frame
	4. value (defined via the *Planning Poker*);

- **Planning poker** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> team leaders and site manager assign a score (*1*, *3*, *5*, *8*, *13*) to each user story and submit the proposal to the site engineer.

- **MVP** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> the [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_Viable_Product) is the goal to which every each user story should comply: it should be a minimal functional outcome. The scope of this outcome is minimal in the sense that it represents the essential elements that define the product. Why it is important to state the user story in terms of MVP? This is because, usually, avoid increasing the complexity that might often lead to burdensome development’s activities. 

- **PDCA Cycle** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> PDCA is the acronyms for *Plan*, *Do*, *Check*, *Act*; These are recursive phases: 

	1. Plan
	2. Do
	3. Check
	4. Apply

- **Sprints** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> Sprints, or “time boxes”, have fixed time-frame. A sprint is technically a single PDCA cycle inside the project.

- **Sprint Retrospective** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> it is the sprint self-assessment accomplished by team leaders wth the help of The Site Manager; this step correspond to phase (3) of PDCA Cycle. Sprint retrospective is composed by five questions. The relative answers are used in the (4) phase of PDCA Cycle:
  - Are you satisfied by your user stories? (1 to 5)
  - Were the connections among the team expertise useful? (1 to 5)
  - How quick the team spotted errors? (1 to 5)
  - Were there burdens in the user story –like, unsolved issues, problems in detecting mistakes and so on? (1 to 5)
  - Was the stipulated time-frame for the user story appropriate? (1 to 5)
